        <h3>ABOUT</h3>
        <p>My name is Tiago. I am in my late 20s and I’m originally from Lisbon, although I’m currently living in
            Slovenia. I work for Renaissance Periodization (RP) and I have my own coaching business where I help
            people with their training and fitness
            goals.

            <br><br>I’ve always been somewhat of a nerd, so when I started my fitness journey almost 10 years ago,
            that led me to learn everything I could about it. I was obsessed with it, learning about training and
            nutrition every single day. I
            initially started with Youtube videos, but soon started to read books and blogs. Eventually, that
            progressed to textbooks, scientific articles, and several courses and certifications.

            <br><br>I got particularly interested in exercise and nutritional science and making sure my methods
            were evidence-based rather than just following traditional unproven practices. Especially since like
            many others, I ended up following
            poor advice and making me spin my wheels. There is nothing more frustrating than putting in hours of
            work trying to achieve your goal but not making any progress. The more I learned the better I was able
            to improve my own results. I want
            to help you avoid misinformation and get to your goal in the most efficient manner possible.

            <h4> WHAT ARE A FEW IMPORTANT THINGS YOU SHOULD KNOW ABOUT MY COACHING SERVICES?</h4>
            <div id="s-text">
                <h6>YOU HAVE TO BE WILLING TO WORK HARD</h6>
                <p>I can help you reach your goals, but you’re the one doing the work. I can not train or diet for
                    you.</p>

                <h6>RESULTS TAKE TIME</h6>
                <p>I wish I could say I will get you super big, strong, or lean in a few weeks, but that just
                    doesn’t happen. I don’t promise quick results, and everyone who does is being deceitful. This
                    doesn’t mean you won’t get to your goals, but
                    just be mindful it requires work and time.</p>

                <h6>I ALWAYS HAVE SUSTAINABILITY IN MIND</h6>
                <p>I will never compromise long-term results for faster short-term progress.</p>

                <h6>I’M NOT A MOTIVATIONAL COACH</h6>
                <p>The best way of thinking about our coach-client relationship is that I’m guiding you, but I can’t
                    motivate you to train or diet. You have to have the willpower to reach your goals, and with my
                    experience and knowledge, I will help
                    to reach them in the easiest, safest and most effective way possible.</p>

    <div id="benefits-items">
        <h3>BENEFITS</h3>
        <h4>Why should you hire a coach? It’s a very reasonable question. You can absolutely get stronger, leaner
            and fitter on your own. But coaching has some unique advantages that might make the progress a lot
            easier.
        </h4>
        <div id="benefits-text">
            <h5>ADVICE</h5>
            <p>Nowadays you can search for anything on the internet, but without a solid foundation of knowledge,
                it’s incredibly hard to know what is good information.<br> What foods should you eat? How many
                calories do you need? How much training volume
                should you do? Are you doing too much or too little? How should your training be structured? How do
                you overcome plateaus?<br> These questions aren’t easy to answer unless you have experience and
                knowledge, and searching online will
                give you countless contradictory answers. A good coach can tell you exactly what you need to do and
                also the reason behind it. You don’t have to constantly be worried about what is legitimate or not.
            </p>

            <h5>ACCOUNTABILITY</h5>
            <p>Most people fail because they simply stop doing what’s necessary to produce the result they want,
                even if they know what they should do.<br> When you’re doing something on your own, it’s hard to
                keep yourself accountable. If you have someone
                watching for you, you now feel responsible for your own actions. You know someone cares about your
                progress and wants you to succeed, so you feel bad if you disappoint them. Accountability makes sure
                you stick to the plan and don’t
                sabotage yourself.
            </p>

            <h5>OBJECTIVITY</h5>
            <p>It’s hard to be objective about your training and dieting. This is one of the reasons why it’s common
                for coaches to also get coached by someone else. Even with all the knowledge and experience in the
                world, it’s impossible to be objective
                about your own progress.<br> People often start over-analyzing everything, worrying about every
                little detail. If their weight isn’t going as it’s supposed to, they’re very inclined to change
                calories too soon, or if they miss a rep
                in their training, they immediately think something is wrong with their programming.<br> They do
                this because they lack objectivity, they can’t look at themselves without their own biases. This is
                where a coach comes in: they can analyse
                your progress with detachment, avoiding unnecessary changes that can harm your long-term progress.
            </p>

        <h4>I follow an approach to my coaching based on evidence-based practice (EBP), which optimizes
            decision-making for medical practitioners. Here I adapted it to evidence-based coaching (EBC). </h4>
        <img src="images/chart.png" alt="" id="img-chart">
        <div id="benefits-text2">
            <h6>EBC relies on 3 foundations:</h6>
            <p><b>Research Evidence:</b> Decisions must be based on scientific evidence, and the strength of the
                evidence should be considered. For example, research has consistently shown that high volume is
                beneficial for hypertrophy. <br>
                <br>
                <b>Coaching Experience:</b> Practitioner experience is paramount and should be synergistic with
                research for the best outcomes. For instance, I have noticed that low-intensity deloads are often
                detrimental to strength in a powerlifting
                context. Reducing fatigue by relative intensity and volume instead seems to work better in my
                experience. <br>
                <br>
                <b>Client’s Preferences:</b> The client's preferences and values must be taken into account, and the
                ultimate goal is to help the client reach their own personal goals. While this also applies to
                training, it’s best seen in nutrition.
                No matter how good of a plan it is, people aren’t going to follow a diet they don’t like.

                With both the Gold and Silver packages, you get a completely individualized plan to reach your goals.
                The difference is the amount of contact you have with me.
            </p>
            <p>If you have the gold package, then you can ask me any questions or concerns you may have every day, by
                either WhatsApp or Messager. We will also have a private Facebook group just for the two of us. This
                will be used for the weekly check-in
                with me where you describe how your week went. Ideally, the check-in is done by a 2-4 minute video. The
                Facebook group is also useful to post progress pictures, lifting videos for technique analysis, or
                anything else that you want
                to share.</p>
            <p>Based on your weekly feedback and the data you logged during the week, I will adjust your plan as needed,
                and a new week will automatically show up in your client spreadsheet. At the end of the month, I am
                available for a 1on1 video call
                if you want to discuss any aspect of your diet or training more in-depth.</p>
            <p>With the silver package, the contact is more limited. You also have a scheduled check-in, but it's
                monthly instead of weekly. The plan is changed monthly rather than weekly, and the contact is done by
                email. There is no video call beyond the initial assessment call. </p>
            <p>The difference is how much guidance you need. If you struggle with accountability, as most people do, the
                gold package is preferred. But if you mostly want to get a solid training and diet program to follow, or
                if your budget is limited,
                then the silver package might be a better option.</p>

                <p>There are a few situations that grant a discount: <br><br> ○
                    Clients that have worked with me for longer than
                    1 year get 10% off <br> ○ Students get a 20% discount.<br> ○ Referrals or double-sign ups get a

                    my clients get. I wrote it myself and
                    only my clients have access. This started as a private page on my website, but it got so big
                    that I figured a book would be more suitable. <br><br> You will have it shipped to your door
                    when you sign up. It includes detailed information
                    about training and nutrition that is specific to how I do my client’s programming and nutrition.
                    It also has many nutrition tips on how to make dieting easier, such as how to structure meal
                    prepping, how to eat out while dieting,
                    specific recipes, and more.

            <h6>Getting your plan is an easy process and just takes a few days. It has roughly 4 steps:</h6>
            <p>1. By clicking the contact section of this website you will be able to reach me by email. You can
                give a very brief introduction about yourself and mention the plan you’re interested in. Nothing in
                detail is required since that will come
                later.
                <br><br> 2. I will answer your email in 24 hours, and I will send you a questionnaire for you to
                fill. This is where you will give me all your information. Everything about your goals, your
                history, your preferences, etc.<br><br> 3.
                After you have filled the questionnaire and I have reviewed it, we can book a free video call in
                order to discuss any concerns you may have. I typically have availability to book it for the very
                next day, so that you get your plan
                as soon as possible. This call is beneficial but not required, it can also be done by email if you
                so prefer. <br><br> 4. Following the call I will have all the necessary information, and I will
                start working on your plan as soon as
                possible. You will receive it by email in a few days and you can start right away.
